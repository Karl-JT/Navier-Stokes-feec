# Navier-Stokes-feec

Finite elements exterior calculus scheme to solve the Navier-Stokes equations. 
It is intended for use within the FEniCS framework <http://www.fenicsproject.org/>.
The scheme is detailed in <https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05146>.
This repo holds an implementation of the numerical simulations mentioned in the paper.
